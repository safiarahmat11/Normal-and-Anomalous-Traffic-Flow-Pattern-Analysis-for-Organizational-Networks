# Normal-and-Anomalous-Traffic-Flow-Pattern-Analysis-for-Organizational-Networks
In  this  work,  we  attempt  to determine the typical characteristics seen in various organizational network  traffic.  We  use  simple  flow  analysis  methods  on  different datasets which include normal and anomalous traffic. Results from such  an  analysis  can  play  a  vital  role  in  problems  ranging  from feature selection for machine learning based models to help tune the rules of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Based on the analysis of  number  of  flows,  packet  size,  number  of  packets  per  flow,  flow duration,  and  protocol  composition  present  in  each  dataset,  we present  our  findings  in  this  work.
